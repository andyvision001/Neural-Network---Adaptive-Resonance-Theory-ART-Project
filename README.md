# Neural-Network---Adaptive-Resonance-Theory-ART-Project
Implementation of the Adaptive Resonance Theory for MNIST dataset. • Compare different vigilance values  • Compare clusters with MNIST classes. 

This project is an implementation of the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) using Python Programming Language. ART is a kind of Neural Network that employs an unsupervised learning method in training network to learn the patterns within the dataset. ART network continuously learn new input patterns without losing sight of the previous. An approach for clustering is applied by ART networks. When an input is given to the network, the algorithm determines if it belongs in one of the clusters that have already been stored. If it does, the input is added to the cluster that most closely matches it; otherwise, a new cluster is created.

This project was implemented on the MNIST dataset. The dataset was divided into the training set (60,000) and the testing set (10,000). Python Programming Language was used in implementing the project. The following python libraries were used while implementing this project: Keras, Pandas, Numpy, Random, and Matplotlib.pyplot, 

At the end of this implementation, the network was able to compare different vigilance values and also compare clusters with MNIST classes. The network performed 14 iterations on the dataset and after successful learning and updating the vectors, the contingency matrix was obtained.
